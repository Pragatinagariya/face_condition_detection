[Note: This would be a binary TensorFlow Lite model file containing the pre-trained emotion recognition model. Since we can't actually generate binary files here, you would need to download a suitable pre-trained emotion recognition model for TensorFlow Lite or create one using TensorFlow and convert it to TFLite format. The file should be placed in the 'assets/models/' directory of your Flutter project.]
